            <h2>TK Maxx presents Lytham Festival</h2>
            <p>
              TK Maxx presents Lytham Festival has grown from a one-night-only
              community Proms-style concert to a spectacular five-day live music
              event which now attracts well in excess of 120,000 people each
              summer. Staged on the banks of Lancashire's stunning Ribble
              Estuary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Headliners have varied massively over the years ranging from the
              likes of Lionel Richie, Sting, Billy Ocean, Diana Ross, Duran
              Duran, Kylie, Lewis Capaldi, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds,
              Nile Rodgers & CHIC, Madness, Rod Stewart, Stereophonics, The
              Strokes, Tom Jones and so many more.
            </p>
            <p>
              2024 will see five nights of live music light up Lytham Green once
              again. This tranquil beauty spot is normally reserved for dog
              walkers, kite flyers and family picnics but for one week each
              summer it is transformed into a buzzing live music hub as artists
              from across the globe perform to crowds of up to 20,000 people a
              night.
